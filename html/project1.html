            iPad of a 10 year old with unsupervised internet access

        <p class="intro">
            My first generation iPad was the love of my life during childhood. <br>
            I couldn't take photos on it but I still had the most fun time exploring the internet with no one to stop me.<br>
            I remember filling up my storage with at least 10GB of games, my dad made me delete most of them and I cried. <br>
            This website would be a representation of what my iPad looked like back then! <br>
            Unfortunately most of these games are gone now so I can only look back at these and be happy I got to experience them.
